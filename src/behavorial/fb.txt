Behavioral: Do not underestimate this one, as for example Google introduced it
 recently since they understood the importance of such interview.
 Prepare some answers to questions like Tell me one time where you
 disagree with your colleagues or Tell me one time that you went
 outside your normal boundaries to complete some tasks. My suggestion
 here is be real, try to come up with real scenarios from your experience, which may very well be stuff from university. Do not try to fool the interviewer with cool answers, these guys have been doing interviews for many years and they most likely know how to spot a fake answer. Amazon requires a special preparation, as you need to go through all their principles and associate 1 or 2 stories to each of the principle.
