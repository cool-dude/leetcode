/**
 * Let's say a positive integer is a superpalindrome if it is a palindrome, and it is also the square of a palindrome.
 *
 * Now, given two positive integers L and R (represented as strings), return the number of superpalindromes in the inclusive range [L, R].
 * Input: L = "4", R = "1000"
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: 4, 9, 121, and 484 are superpalindromes.
 * Note that 676 is not a superpalindrome: 26 * 26 = 676, but 26 is not a palindrome.
