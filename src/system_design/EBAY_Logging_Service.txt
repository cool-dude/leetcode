My answer :
write your logs from system to a file from any logger
library in async way (keep the format hourly so that file
size do not become huge and keeping in mind ebays traffic)
eg : xyz.01-01-2020-01.gz
every ebay server (it has to be distributed) will
write this hourly file into a file system
at the end of the day , a cron/service collects these
files and put them in separate machine (storage server : basically a cluster of mochines)
machine where storage happens can be obtained by
following consistent hashing mechanism : generate the hash
of file name from a hash function and store the file on
corresponding machine
retrieval service can take input of time and at retriving part,
use the same hash function to get the appropriate machine where the file is and serve it.
