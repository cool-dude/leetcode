/**You will be given a list of stock prices for a given day and your goal is
 * to return the maximum profit that could have been made by buying a stock at
 * the given price and then selling the stock later on. For example if the
 * input is: [45, 24, 35, 31, 40, 38, 11] then your program should return 16
 * because if you bought the stock at $24 and sold it at $40, a profit of $16 was
 * made and this is
 * the largest profit that could be made. If no profit could have been made, return -1.
 *
 *
 * Solution Algorithm:
 * (1) Iterate through each number in the list.
 * (2) At the ith index, get the i+1 index price and check if it is larger than the ith index price.
 * (3) If so, set buy_price = i and sell_price = i+1. Then calculate the profit: sell_price - buy_price.
 * (4) If a stock price is found that is cheaper than the current buy_price, set this to be the new buying price and continue from step 2.
 * (5) Otherwise, continue changing only the sell_price and keep buy_price set.
