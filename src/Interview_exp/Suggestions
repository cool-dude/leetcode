Main takeaways I have
Spend a lot of time and really immerse yourself in resources l
ike Leetcode, tech Youtube channels, conferences, etc.
 Once you do this ideas will start coming to your head about
  how to pass these interviews. This is very underrated tip.
  Everyone has different methods of how they break into companies,
  simply grinding problems isn't enough. If you are reading and
  immersing yourself in a bunch of different content, you will
  find out what works best for YOU to get an offer.
Make interview prep fun. I was not a CS major so prepping for
Leetcode was very daunting for me. I hated idea of going to library,
reading Cracking the Coding Interview, and struggling to solve Reverse Linked List.
 What changed for me was when I made the studying ‘fun’. I studied with friends,
 talked about it in groups online, bought myself food/snacks when studying, etc.
 I would laugh with friends and meme about different problems. I
  started to look forward to working on Leetcode and that consequently made me get good.
Don't forget that interviewer is human.

IMP:Problems: https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/448285/List-of-questions-sorted-by-common-patterns
 found a list of questions sorted by pattern on Hackernoon.
 This is the link for the article https://hackernoon.com/14-patterns-to-ace-any-coding-interview-question-c5bb3357f6ed.
 I created a LeetCode list for each of the patterns. I found it pretty useful, feel free to make a copy of the list and use it.
