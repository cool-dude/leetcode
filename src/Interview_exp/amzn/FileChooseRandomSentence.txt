 Given a file with large number of sentences,
 choose a sentence randomly where all sentences have equal probability.

I could not really solve this question. I gave him few approaches
like counting number of sentences and then choosing a
random between and then choosing a line.
However, I later realized I could have normalized the
sentence length by subtracting mean length and dividing by
standard variance. But I am not sure if this approach would have satisfied the interviewer.
