In Java: Priority Queue is implemented
        using Heap Data Structures and Heap
        has O(log(n)) time complexity to insert and delete element.

        a)Offer() and add() methods are used to
        insert the element in the in the
        priority queue java program.
        //T:O(lgn).

        b)Poll() and remove() is used to
        delete the element from the queue.
        //T:O(lgn)

        c)Element retrieval methods i.e.
        peek() and element()
        from the head of the queue.
        //T:O(1).

        d) contains(Object)method that is used to check
        particular element is present in the queue,
        //T:O(n).
