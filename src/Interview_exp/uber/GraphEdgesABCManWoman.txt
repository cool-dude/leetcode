Graph edges A,B,C traversed by man, woman and both.
Q:Given a graph where each edge is one of the three types:
A, B and C. A type edge can only be traversed by a man.
B type edge can only be traversed by a woman and C type
can be traversed by both.

  You need to tell the maximum number of edges that can
  be removed from the graph so that it can still be fully
  traversed by both a man and a woman.

SLN: Let's assume that by not removing any edge,
the graph is traversable by both - man and woman.
Otherwise, there is no solution.
    Let the number of man edges be M and the number of woman edges be W.
    First, we will start adding all edges that can be traversed by both -
    man and woman, 1 by 1. Use the disjoint set union data structure for this.
    If by adding a new edge we connect 2 nodes in the same connected component,
    we discard that edge, otherwise, we add it. Let the number of edges
    discarded in this process be D. Now, you will have some number
    of connected components. Let this number be K. Now, only considering
    man edges, each non-redundant man edge should reduce the number
    of connected components by 1. Hence, minimum number of man edges that
    must be added to make sure that we are left with exactly 1
    connected components at the end is K - 1. Hence we will be discarding
    M - (K - 1) man edges. We do the same thing for woman edges.
    Hence, we will be diacarding W - ( K - 1) woman edges.
    Hence total edges discarded = D + (W - (K - 1) )+ (M - (K - 1)).
