/*LC3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Example 1:
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Example 2:
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
he basic idea is, keep a hashmap which stores the characters in
string as keys and their positions as values, and keep
two pointers which define the max substring. move the
right pointer to scan through the string , and meanwhile
update the hashmap. If the character is already in the hashmap,
then move the left pointer to the right of the same character
last found. Note that the two pointers can only move forward. */
